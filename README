astooki-py -- the astronomical toolkit.

* About

Astooki is a command-line tool for analyzing astronomical data using the
astooki library (astooky-lib). Currently it provides rudimentary image
analysis and conversion routines, as well as more complex analysis tools for
(wide-field) wavefront sensor data.

Both astooki and astooki-lib are written by Tim van Werkhoven.

* Install

To install astooki, first make sure the astooki library is available on your
system. Then simply copy astooki-py to a directory in your path and use it

* Howto

To get rudimentary information on how to use astooki, run
   astooki-py --help
and all options will be displayed along with some basic information. A more 
complete list of what astooki can do is given below:

** Stats tool

Purpose: calculate statistics on images
Arguments:

** Convert tool

Purpose: convert images from one format to another.
Arguments:

Notes: Supported input formats currently include: ana, fits, npy. Output formats include fits, npy and png

** Shiftoverlay tool

Purpose: visualize image shifts on the raw images


** Samask tool

Purpose: make a subaperture mask, giving a file with centroid and lower-left coordinates for a mask of subapertures or subimages

** Sfmask tool

Purpose: make a subfield mask

** Saopt tool

Purpose: Optimze a subaperture mask with a flatfield image

** Saupd tool

Purpose: Update a subaperture mask with an offset

** Shifts tool

Purpose: measure image shifts in various subfields and subimages

** Procshifts tool

Purpose: process shifts measured with the shifts tool

** Tomo tool

Purpose: tomographically analyze differential image shifts

- 20090514: configfile support
- 20090514: calculate layer sizes at each height (need tel fov?)
- 20090514: take telescope angle into account

  Need to know for Tomo
  -> layer heights (for each geom ())
  -> layer sizes (for each geom f(heights))
  -> layer cells (for each geom f())
  -> layer origins (for each geom, f(tel pointing))
  -> subap position, size: gives (meta-) apertures
  -> subfield position, size: gives subfield pointing, fov
